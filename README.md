# LSA PROJECT 4
## Distributed Filesystem

Corba something-something, distributed other-thing

## bin/*

All of the output files can be raked into the bin directory by running `gatherBins.sh`.
This is to make running the project on the servers easier.
Additionally, the compiled .class files have been removed from the `bin/.gitignore`, also to make deploying easier.
